                  <p>The biggest cause of disability in Europe is low back pain. The economic cost of low back pain is nearly 1% of the gross domestic product in the European countries. </p>

                  <p>Self-management in the form of physical activity and strength or stretching exercises is the core component in the management of low back pain. However, most patients find it 
                    challenging to adhere to a self-management plan because of lack of feedback and reinforcement. In the selfBACK project we will solve this problem by developing a decision support 
                    system that will help the patient to choose the best actions to reduce pain and improve function. The decision support will be delivered via smartphone app and the advice will be 
                    tailored to each patients’ symptoms and a range of patient characteristics including information from a physical activity detecting wristband, worn by the patient. To tailor the 
                    advice for self-management we will use a technology called case-based reasoning. With this method we can use information about previous patients who have successfully managed their 
                    low back pain to design the best possible plan for self-management for new patients. Towards the end of the project, we will determine how effective the selfBACK system is in a 
                    randomized control trial. Compared to patients who receive treatment as usual, we anticipate that patients who use the cell fax system will have at least a 20% reduction in pain related disability.

          <p>The recent global burden of disease study showed that low back pain is the most significant contributor to disability in Europe. Moreover, non- specific low back pain is the fourth most 
            common diagnosis seen in primary care. Every year, about 1 of 15 people in the European population will consult their general practitioner with low back pain. Accordingly, low back pain is 
            one of the most common reasons for activity limitation, sick leave, and work disability.
          </p>
          <p>Current evidence-based guidelines suggest that the most well-documented and effective approach to manage non-specific low back pain is to discourage bed rest (acute stage), reassure the 
           patient about the favourable prognosis (acute stage), advise the patient to stay active both on and off work (acute, sub- acute and chronic stage), and advise strength and/or stretching 
           exercise (sub-acute and chronic stage). These guidelines have been adopted and refined by several European countries to offer the best practice and advice to manage low back pain.

                <h4>Backing self-management</h4>
                <p>The selfBACK project is a healthcare programme centred round self-management and has the potential to save both time and monetary resources in the field of low back pain. The overall aim of 
                 the project is to improve the self-management of non-specific low back pain in order to prevent chronicity, recurrence and pain-related disability. To achieve this we are currently developing
                 a decision support system – selfBACK – that will be used by the patients in the self-management of low back pain. The patient receives this information through a smartphone app, providing 
                 advice to reinforce their personalised self-management plan.​ <a class="nav-publishing" href="http://www.selfback.eu/publications.html"><b>Read more....</b></a></p>
